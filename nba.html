                   <p>In this project, real data on past basketball players is utilized to inform investment decisions in basketball memorabilia using machine learning techniques. The dataset consists of information on 495 players, including 27 different predictors or attributes for each player. These attributes are often abbreviated, and a complete list can be found at the end of this project documentation. <br/>
                    <br/>
                    The historical dataset, Hall-of-fame-train.arff, serves as the foundation for building a classification model that predicts the likelihood of a player's induction into the hall of fame, along with the corresponding probability. Subsequently, the model is applied to select players for potential investment opportunities. The primary objective of this assignment is to develop practical experience in developing and evaluating machine learning models to inform interventions, specifically investment decisions, with the ultimate goal of maximizing profitability. <br/>
                    <br/>
                    The dataset includes a target variable, which indicates whether a player has been inducted into the hall of fame. It is worth noting that in this dataset, players who have not been inducted 45.4 years after retirement are assumed to never be inducted. The target variable is binary, with a value of 1 representing induction and 0 indicating non-induction. The data includes the actual target variable value for each player, enabling evaluation of the effectiveness of investment decisions and facilitating comparisons among investments selected by different models to identify the most optimal model for future use. <br/>

                            <p>ROC area is more appropriate because the models are working with an imbalanced dataset. To be inducted into the Hall of Fame is a rare event which means that this is an imbalanced dataset. When using classification accuracy, it is possible that a model seems very accurate because it predicted that most players will not be inducted, but that may not be accurate because the number of players that actually get inducted is already very small. An ROC curve takes this into account because it takes into account the true postive rate and false postive rate and asseses the model's ability to distinguish between the them. The fact that a dataset is imbalanced will not affect the assessment outcome.

                            <p>To select the the best features for prediction, features were evaluated based on information gain, chi-square, and correlation matrix.

fga    0.688851</code></pre>

                        <p>In this scenario, class or whether or not a player is inducted to the hall of fame is made to be binary. The correlation coefficient can be used to measure the relationship between the binary variable and continous variables. Information gain and correlation matrix have an identical consesus on the top three features (ftm, fta, fga) while Chi-squared only has fga in common with info gain and correlation matrix. <br/>
                        <br/>
                        It is also important to note that statistics such as points, assists, and rebounds that are represented as a cumulative value over a player's careers are not informative predictor for both young and older players' likelihood of being inducted to the Hall of Fame because players with longer careers my have higher cumulative values simply because they have been playing longer, not because they play better than players with shorter careers. To make these predictors useful, using averages or ratios instead may adjust for career length. For example, instead of using total points over a player's career, using average points per game may be more predictive for both age groups. There would be less bias towards older players since older players. Older playeres likely will have been playing longer and will therefore more likely have higher cumulative statistics which is biased.
                        </p>

                        <p>The model was further refined by creating and removing features and evaluated based on the cross-validation score. This involved using backwards selection. Wrapper method was attempted but were not successful due to RAM limitations. Some features that were created were from turning cumulative values into ratios instead.

                            <h2>Investment Decisions</h2>
                            <p>Assume this project involves working with a budget of $4,000,000 to invest in players' memorabilia. The cost of each piece is $40,000, and a maximum of 100 players' memorabilia can be purchased. The challenge is that we don't know which players will be inducted into the hall of fame. The NBA will release this information in the future, and we need to make investment decisions before that happens.
                                <br/>
                                <br/>
                                There are two possible outcomes for our investments. If we invest in a player who later becomes a hall of famer, we can expect a revenue of $120,000 when selling their memorabilia. However, if we invest in a player who is not inducted, we will lose 50% of our initial investment, which is $20,000.
                                <br/>
                                <br/>
                                The goal is to develop, evaluate, and apply an investment strategy. This strategy involves choosing a predictive model to estimate the probability of a player's induction and determining a threshold probability above which it is profitable to invest. We need to carefully consider these factors to maximize our profitability and make informed investment decisions.
                                <br/>
                                <br/>
                                First, the modified data is split into training and testing. Using the features selected above, each model is evaluated again. 
                                The most approriate evaluation measure for selecting which players to invest in would be a profit chart. We need to know how much profit is being made with each number of investments made. The profit chart made in this context would show the expected profit or loss from investing in a certain number of players. The goal is to maximize profit and that is most observable using a profit chart to determine the optimal model and threshold that maximize profit. A lift chart would not be suitable because it only shows the effectivenss of a binary classifier rather than determining the maximum profit possible.

                             <p>To invest in a player's memorabilia, the predicted probability of induction should be above the threshold of 0.28. Players with higher probability of induction should be prioritized for investment.
                            The strategy will involve using the random forest model to predict the probability of induction for each player and select players above the threshold. This will also consider the $4,000,000 budget and limit to a max of 100 players.
